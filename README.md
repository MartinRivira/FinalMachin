# Image Classification for Flowers Using CNN

Description
This project is an image classification model designed to classify flowers into different categories (e.g., roses, daisies, tulips) based on input images. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to achieve this goal. The model is trained using a dataset of flower images and can predict the class of a flower when a new image is provided.

Features
Classifies images of flowers into predefined categories.
Uses data augmentation to improve model performance on limited datasets.
Can identify flowers like roses, daisies, tulips, and more.
Dataset
The dataset consists of images of flowers organized in different folders, each representing a class. Example classes include:

Rose
Daisy
Tulip
Dandelion
Sunflowe
